MongoDB Practice NotesHii  I practiced MongoDB basics using Mongo Playground.  These are the commands I tried while learning CRUD operations.---Database UsedschoolCollection: students---Insert DataInsert single student```jsdb.students.insertOne({  name: "Shivani",  course: "BCA",  marks: 88})```Insert multiple students```jsdb.students.insertMany([  { name: "Amit", course: "BCA", marks: 70 },  { name: "Neha", course: "BSc", marks: 90 }])```---Read DataView all students```jsdb.students.find()```Students with marks greater than 75```jsdb.students.find({ marks: { $gt: 75 } })```Sort students by marks (high to low)```jsdb.students.find().sort({ marks: -1 })```---Update DataUpdate marks of Shivani```jsdb.students.updateOne(  { name: "Shivani" },  { $set: { marks: 95 } })```---Delete DataDelete one record```jsdb.students.deleteOne({ name: "Amit" })```---What I LearnedHow collections workHow to insert and filter dataHow sorting works in MongoDBBasic update and delete commands
