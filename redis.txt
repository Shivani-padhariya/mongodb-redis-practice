# Redis Practice Notes

Today I practiced Redis commands using online Redis playground.  
These commands helped me understand how Redis stores data in key-value format.

---

## Basic Commands

Set value
```
SET username "Shivani"
```

Get value
```
GET username
```

Delete key
```
DEL username
```

---

## Expiry Example

OTP example
```
SET otp 4567
EXPIRE otp 30
TTL otp
```

---

## Counter Example

```
SET visits 1
INCR visits
```

---

## Hash Example

```
HSET user:1 name Shivani age 21
HGETALL user:1
```

---

## List Example

```
LPUSH tasks "MongoDB practice"
LPUSH tasks "Redis practice"
LRANGE tasks 0 -1
```

---

## What I Learned
- Redis is very fast because it stores data in memory
- TTL helps in auto deleting keys
- Hash works like object
- List works like stack or queue
